- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kirsho, Olivier Kirsh. I'm maÃ®tre de confÃ©rences (assistant prof) at universitÃ© Paris CitÃ©, at the BiBs plateform of UMR7216 (Epigenetics and Cell Fate Lab). I'm teaching biostatistics, bioinformatics and molecular biology.  
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in epigenomics and bioinformatics methods to decipher gene expression regulation. I daily work with R and bash under conda environment or singularity containers.      
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning (I have to ...) python and snake make.
